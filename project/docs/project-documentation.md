# Emoji Cipher: A Homomorphic-Inspired Text-to-Emoji Conversion System

## Abstract

This project presents an innovative approach to text-to-emoji conversion using homomorphic-inspired principles. The system implements a bidirectional cipher that transforms plain text into emoji sequences while preserving certain algebraic properties similar to homomorphic encryption. Unlike traditional encryption methods, this system maintains readability and visual appeal while offering a unique way to encode messages. The implementation leverages modern web technologies including React and TypeScript to create an intuitive user interface for encoding and decoding messages. The system's key feature is its homomorphic-like property where the concatenation of encoded messages is equivalent to encoding concatenated messages, making it particularly useful for social media and messaging applications where message composition is common.

## Relationship to Current Project

Our Emoji Cipher project draws inspiration from these works while taking a unique approach. Unlike traditional homomorphic encryption schemes that focus on mathematical operations, our system emphasizes visual representation and user experience while maintaining some homomorphic properties. The project specifically builds upon the visual cryptography concepts from Chen and Wang's work while incorporating the practical implementation considerations from Microsoft SEAL.

The key innovation in our approach is the balance between security features and user experience, creating a system that's both engaging and functional. While not providing the full security guarantees of traditional homomorphic encryption, our system offers a practical solution for casual message encoding with the added benefit of visual appeal through emoji representation.
